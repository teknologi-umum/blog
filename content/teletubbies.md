Teletubbies is a British children's television series created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport for the BBC. The programme focuses on four differently coloured characters known as "Teletubbies", named after the television screens on their bellies. Recognised throughout popular culture for the uniquely shaped antenna protruding from the head of each character, the Teletubbies communicate through gibberish and were designed to bear resemblance to toddlers.[7]

The series rapidly became a commercial success in Britain and abroad. It won multiple BAFTA awards and was nominated for two Daytime Emmys throughout its run.[8][9] A single based on the show's theme song reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1997 and remained in the Top 75 for 32 weeks, selling over a million copies.[10] By October 2000, the franchise generated over £1 billion ($1.6 billion) in merchandise sales.[11]

Though the original run ended in 2001,[12] a rebooted series was green-lit in 2014.[13] The reboot premiered on CBeebies in the United Kingdom and on the Nick Jr. Channel in the United States.[14] Re-runs of the original 1997–2001 series continue to be shown on television channels worldwide.

The original series returned to live TV in the US on Pluto TV on 1 May 2019, but the episodes are shown in the UK format instead of the US format. The same error occurred with the series' availability on the Noggin app since 25 May 2016.
